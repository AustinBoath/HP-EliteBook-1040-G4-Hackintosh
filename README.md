# HP-EliteBook-1040-G4-Hackintosh
EFI Folder for the HP EliteBook 1040 G4 (MacOS Big Sur), doesn't include installer files

WARNING: Not proven to work, I have failed with this EFI to hackintosh. If anyone can help make it better, please branch off and be sure to contact me! Right now I would recommend using the HP EliteBook 840 G4 repo instead for the time being: https://github.com/kreizlie/HP-EliteBook-840-G4-Hackintosh

Specifications of the particular laptop:
CPU: i5-7200u (Kaby Lake)
GPU: Intel HD Graphics 620
RAM: 8gb DDRsomething
